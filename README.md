Hi, there!
If you're reading this then you're either extremely bored or extremely smart and know something I don't, as this project has literally nothing going on.
I was bored one day and wanted to make a simple Conway's game of life clone, and so that is exactly what I did. I doubt this is the fastest or smoothest implementation, but it's
something. If you want to use the code for something, all you have to do is change the part where it accepts input. Instead of the user implementing every single pixel that's 
on, you can have it read it from an image (Say, a picture with only black and white pixels is turned into the matrix and then the "game" is run) or from something else.

Have fun if anyone ever reads it and if you read this far, comment "BLT"
